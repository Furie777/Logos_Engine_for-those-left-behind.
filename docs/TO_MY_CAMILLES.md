# TO MY CAMILLES: A FATHER'S PROVISION
## *Should I Go Home Early*

---

## THE OPENING WORD

**To Tristan Camille, my beloved wife:**

If you are reading this, then the vision I have carried since childhood has come to pass. I am 33 and a half—Christ's age at crucifixion—and I have gone home to the Father before you. This is not written in fear, but in **submission**. "Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him" (Job 13:15).

You are not reading words of despair. You are reading your **inheritance**. And when the time is right, you will pass this inheritance to our daughter.

**To Lavender Camille, my precious daughter:**

Your mother will give you this when you are old enough to understand. You may not remember my face, but you will know my heart through these words. I loved you before you were born. I love you now from wherever I am. And the God who took me home **loves you more than I ever could**.

You are named Camille—"perfect," "unblemished," "helper to the priest." You and your mother both carry this name. It means you are **set apart for holy work**. Your mother is Tristan—"sorrowful" but also "faithful lover." You are Lavender—"devotion," "grace," "serenity."

**These names are prophecy.** Your mother will walk through sorrow, but her love remains faithful. You will bring grace and calm to her grief. Together, you are **Camille**—perfect in God's eyes, helpers in His temple.

---

**To Both My Camilles:**

The Lord showed me that you would be widow and fatherless. Not to curse you, but to **prepare you**. Because Scripture is clear: God has specific plans for widows and the fatherless. Not plans to harm you, but **plans to prosper you** (Jeremiah 29:11).

**Psalm 68:5** - "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation."

He will be your Father. He will be your Husband. He will be your Provider. He will be your Defender.

I have gathered every widow story in Scripture. Every promise. Every provision. Every warning. This is your **manual**. This is your **manna**. When you don't know what to do, come back to these pages. The pattern is here.

"As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD" (Joshua 24:15). I declared this when I married Tristan. I declare it now as I prepare to leave you. **Our household stands for God.** That doesn't change when I'm gone. You carry the covenant forward.

Tristan, you are the widow who leads. Lavender, you are the fatherless who rises. Together, you are the **lineage of promise**.

You are not alone. You were **never** alone.

## PART 1: TAMAR'S WAITING - When People Fail You

**Read: Genesis 38:6-30**

The first widow named in Scripture is **Tamar**.

Her husband Er died. God's judgment. Then his brother Onan died. God's judgment again. Her father-in-law Judah said: **"Remain a widow at your father's house until my son Shelah grows up"** (Genesis 38:11).

So she waited. She put on **widow's garments** and sat at her father's house. She was in limbo—not divorced, not remarried, not provided for. Just... waiting.

But Shelah grew up, and Judah didn't keep his promise. He forgot her. Left her waiting forever.

**Here's what Tamar did:** She took off her widow's garments, covered herself with a veil, and positioned herself where Judah would see her. Not in rebellion, but in **pursuit of the promise**. She bore twins—Perez and Zerah. Through Perez came King David. Through David came **Christ**.

Judah later said of her: **"She hath been more righteous than I"** (Genesis 38:26).

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Widowhood brings waiting - Sometimes long, sometimes unclear
2. Men may fail to provide - Even those who promised
3. God provides through unexpected means - Not always the way you expect
4. Your lineage matters - What you carry goes beyond you
5. Righteousness is recognized eventually - Even if not immediately

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** When people fail you—and they will—**God will not**. When provision is delayed, **it's not denied**. When you feel forgotten, remember: **you are in the lineage of Christ**. Our son carries covenant seed. His children will carry it forward. You are not just surviving; you're **preserving the line**.

**Lavender:** Your mama may have to wait for things. She may feel forgotten sometimes. But she is righteous, just like Tamar. And you, sweet girl, are part of the promise that comes from her faithfulness. Your very existence is **God keeping His word**.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Genesis 38 (full chapter - Tamar's full story)
- Ruth 4:18-22 (Perez in Christ's genealogy)
- Matthew 1:3 (Tamar honored in Jesus' lineage)

## PART 2: NAOMI & RUTH - When Everything Is Lost

**Read: Book of Ruth (all 4 chapters)**

Naomi lost her husband Elimelech. Then both her sons died. Three widows in one house—Naomi, Ruth, Orpah. No men. No provision. No future.

Naomi was so broken she changed her name. She said: **"Call me not Naomi [pleasant], call me Mara [bitter]: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me"** (Ruth 1:20).

She had nothing. Nothing except a Moabite daughter-in-law who refused to leave.

**Ruth's vow** (Ruth 1:16-17):
"Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me."

Two widows. Bitter and loyal. They returned to Bethlehem at harvest time. Ruth **gleaned in the fields**—the provision God commanded for widows (Deuteronomy 24:19).

She "happened" to glean in Boaz's field. But it wasn't chance. **It was providence**.

Boaz was their kinsman-redeemer. He married Ruth. She bore Obed. Obed became father of Jesse. Jesse became father of David. David's lineage led to **Christ**.

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Multiple losses can happen at once - Husband and sons both gone
2. Bitterness is honest - God can handle your grief
3. Loyal companionship matters - Ruth stayed when she could have left
4. God's provision laws protect widows - Gleaning wasn't charity, it was LAW
5. "Chance" meetings are providence - You end up where you need to be
6. Kinsman-redeemers exist - Someone will come to restore your line

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** When you feel bitter, **say it**. Naomi didn't hide her pain. She named it. God didn't punish her for honesty. He **redeemed** her through Ruth's loyalty and Boaz's provision. You have family. You have church. You have the body of Christ. Let them be your Ruth. Let God send your Boaz.

You have gleaning rights. **Deuteronomy 24:19-21** isn't suggestion—it's LAW. When harvest comes, when provision appears, when resources flow—**you have legal right** before God to receive. Don't be ashamed to glean. It's your covenant inheritance.

**Lavender:** Your mama might go through seasons where she's so sad she feels bitter. That's okay. Naomi was bitter, but God still used her. He still provided for her. He still made her grandmother to kings.

And baby girl, you might be the Ruth in this story. The one who stays loyal. The one who brings joy back to bitter hearts. Your presence is **healing**.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Ruth 1-4 (read the whole book, it's only 4 chapters)
- Deuteronomy 24:19-21 (gleaning laws - your legal right)
- Ruth 4:13-17 (Naomi holds Obed - bitter turned to joy)
- Matthew 1:5 (Ruth in Christ's genealogy)

## PART 3: THE WIDOW OF ZAREPHATH - When There's Nothing Except

**Read: 1 Kings 17:8-24**

Israel was in drought. Famine everywhere. God sent Elijah to a widow in Zarephath—a **Gentile** widow, outside covenant Israel.

Elijah found her gathering sticks. He asked for water and bread.

Her response (1 Kings 17:12): **"As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die."**

She had **nothing except**:
- Handful of meal
- Little oil
- Two sticks
- One son
- Death waiting

Elijah said: **"Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth"** (1 Kings 17:13-14).

She obeyed. Fed the prophet first. And the meal and oil **never ran out**. She, her son, and Elijah ate for **days** on what should have been one last meal.

Later, her son died. She blamed Elijah. Elijah took the boy, laid on him three times, and cried out to God. **God raised the boy from death**.

**THE PATTERN:**
1. "Nothing except" is still something - God multiplies the little you have
2. Obedience precedes provision - Feed the prophet first
3. Gentiles receive blessing too - You don't have to be "chosen" to be chosen
4. Provision sustains through the whole famine - Not just one meal
5. Even death can be reversed - God brings life from death

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** When you look at bank accounts, cupboards, resources and think "I have nothing except..."—**that's your starting point**. Not your ending point.

What do you have?
- Our son
- Our daughter
- Your faith
- Your hands
- Your mind
- This letter
- The church
- God's promises

Take inventory of your "nothing except" and **give it to God first**. Feed the prophet. Support the ministry. Give the tithe. It sounds crazy when you're starving, but **it unlocks multiplication**.

The barrel of meal shall not waste. The cruse of oil shall not fail. **Until the drought ends**.

And if death comes—sickness, despair, hopelessness—**cry out like Elijah did**. God raises the dead.

**Lavender:** Your mama might have times when it looks like there's nothing left. Just a little bit of food. Just a little bit of money. Just a little bit of hope.

But baby, God specializes in **little bits**. He takes the handful and makes it last through the whole famine. Trust Him with your mama. He's going to take care of you both.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- 1 Kings 17:8-24 (full story of Zarephath widow)
- Matthew 6:33 (seek first the kingdom)
- Malachi 3:10 (bring tithes, I will open windows of heaven)
- Luke 4:25-26 (Jesus references this widow as example of faith)

## PART 4: THE PROPHET'S WIDOW WITH OIL - When Debt Threatens Your Children

**Read: 2 Kings 4:1-7**

A prophet died. His widow came to Elisha crying: **"Thy servant my husband is dead...and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen"** (2 Kings 4:1).

She was about to lose her children to slavery to pay debt.

Elisha asked: **"What hast thou in the house?"**

She answered: **"Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil"** (2 Kings 4:2).

Nothing. Except. A pot of oil.

Elisha told her:
1. **Go borrow vessels** from all your neighbors - empty vessels
2. **Don't gather just a few** - get as many as possible
3. **Go in and shut the door** - you and your sons, private
4. **Pour the oil** - keep pouring until all vessels are full

She obeyed. She poured from her one pot into borrowed vessels. **The oil didn't stop**. She filled one vessel. Then another. Then another.

She kept calling: **"Bring me another vessel!"**

Finally her son said: **"There is not a vessel more."**

**Then the oil stopped** (2 Kings 4:6).

Elisha said: **"Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest"** (2 Kings 4:7).

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Debt can threaten your children's future - But God provides payment
2. God asks what you already have - Not what you wish you had
3. Borrow capacity from others - Use your community's resources
4. Shut the door and work - Some miracles happen in private
5. Oil multiplies to fill available capacity - Your provision matches your preparation
6. The limit isn't God's supply, it's your containers - Get more vessels
7. Sell the blessing, pay the debt, live on the rest - Full provision, not just survival

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** If debt threatens—medical bills, funeral costs, mortgage, whatever—**God can multiply oil**.

What do you have? A skill? A talent? A product? One client? One opportunity? **That's your pot of oil.**

Borrow vessels:
- Ask family for help
- Use church resources
- Access widow funds (1 Timothy 5:3-16)
- Apply for assistance programs
- Let people lend you their capacity (their platforms, their networks, their tools)

Then shut the door. You and our children. Pray. Work. Pour what you have into every vessel you've gathered.

**The oil will fill every vessel you provide**. So provide more vessels. Don't gather just a few. Be ambitious in your preparation.

Then sell the blessing. Pay the debt. **Live on the rest**. Not barely survive—**LIVE**. Abundantly. With margin. With peace.

**Lavender:** If your mama is worried about money, about keeping the house, about paying for things—remind her of the widow with the oil.

God can take the one little thing she has and make it fill up everything she needs. But she has to borrow jars. She has to let people help. And you, sweet girl, you're one of the sons in that room helping pour. You're part of the miracle.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- 2 Kings 4:1-7 (full story)
- Philippians 4:19 (God shall supply all your need)
- Psalm 37:25 (I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread)
- Matthew 6:25-34 (do not be anxious about provision)

## PART 5: THE WIDOW OF NAIN - When Death Takes Your Only Son

**Read: Luke 7:11-17**

Jesus came to the town of Nain. At the gate, a funeral procession was coming out. A dead man being carried—**the only son of his mother, and she was a widow** (Luke 7:12).

She had lost her husband. Now she lost her son. **Everything was gone.**

A considerable crowd was with her—people mourning, but unable to help.

**When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her** (Luke 7:13).

He said: **"Weep not."**

Then He touched the bier (the stretcher carrying the dead body) and said: **"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."**

**The dead man sat up and began to speak. And Jesus gave him to his mother** (Luke 7:15).

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Widows can lose their children too - The worst compounding grief
2. Jesus sees your grief - He had compassion
3. He speaks to death itself - "Weep not" isn't dismissive, it's prophetic
4. He touches what's unclean - Death doesn't defile Him; He cleanses death
5. He raises the dead - What looks finished isn't finished
6. He gives life back to mothers - Restoration of relationship, not just resurrection of body

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** If our son gets sick. If Lavender is endangered. If death threatens our children in any form—physical, spiritual, emotional—**Jesus has compassion**.

He didn't wait for the widow to ask. He didn't require faith first. He just **saw her grief and acted**.

You don't have to be strong. You don't have to have all the right words. You don't have to pray perfectly. **Just be seen by Jesus**. And He will speak to the death threatening your children.

"Young man, arise."
"Young woman, arise."
"Child, come back."

He has authority over death. And He gives life back to mothers.

**Lavender:** Baby, if you ever feel like something in you is dying—hope, joy, faith, dreams—or if you get really sick, or if something terrible happens—**Jesus sees you**.

He saw the widow of Nain and He felt bad for her. He didn't just feel sorry and walk away. He **fixed it**. He brought her son back to life.

He can do the same for you. Nothing is too dead for Him to raise up.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Luke 7:11-17 (full story of widow of Nain)
- John 11:1-44 (Lazarus raised - Jesus weeps with mourners)
- 2 Kings 4:18-37 (Shunammite woman's son raised by Elisha)
- Mark 5:35-43 (Jairus' daughter raised)

## PART 6: THE POOR WIDOW'S TWO MITES - When You Give Everything

**Read: Mark 12:41-44, Luke 21:1-4**

Jesus sat across from the temple treasury, watching people give offerings. Rich people put in large sums.

Then **a poor widow came and put in two mites**, which make a penny (Mark 12:42).

Jesus called His disciples and said: **"Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living"** (Mark 12:43-44).

**She gave everything she had. All she had to live on.**

**THE PATTERN:**
1. God measures giving by sacrifice, not amount - Two mites > thousands
2. Widows' gifts are noticed by Jesus - He's watching specifically for you
3. Giving "all your living" is faith - Trusting God for tomorrow's provision
4. What looks small to others is great to God - Don't despise the day of small things
5. Poverty doesn't disqualify generosity - You can give from want

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** When money is tight and you're tempted to hold back your tithe, your offering, your generosity—remember the widow with two mites.

She gave **all her living**. Not because she was foolish, but because she knew: **God sees. God measures differently. God provides**.

You don't have to give thousands to be a generous giver. You just have to give **proportionally to your faith**.

If you have two dollars and you give one—**that's more in God's economy than a millionaire giving a thousand**.

Don't let poverty make you stingy. Let it make you **dependent on God**. And dependence on God unlocks the windows of heaven.

**Lavender:** When you grow up, you might not have a lot of money. Your mama might not be able to give you everything other kids have.

But sweetie, you come from a line of generous givers. We don't measure wealth by what we keep—we measure it by what we give.

If you only have two dollars and you give one to help someone, **Jesus sees that**. He's watching. And He thinks you're amazing.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Mark 12:41-44 (widow's offering)
- Luke 21:1-4 (same story, different gospel)
- 2 Corinthians 8:1-5 (Macedonians gave beyond their ability)
- 2 Corinthians 9:6-8 (God loves a cheerful giver)

## PART 7: ANNA THE PROPHETESS - When Widowhood Becomes Ministry

**Read: Luke 2:36-38**

Anna was a prophetess, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. **She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from her virginity. And she was a widow of about eighty-four years** (Luke 2:36-37).

She had been a widow for most of her life. Seven years married. Then widowed. Then **decades of widowhood**.

But she **didn't waste it**.

**She departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day** (Luke 2:37).

When Mary and Joseph brought baby Jesus to the temple, Anna was there. She **recognized the Messiah** (Luke 2:38). She gave thanks to the Lord and spoke about Jesus to all who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem.

She was one of the first evangelists. A widow. An old woman. A prophetess.

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Long widowhood can become long ministry - Time isn't wasted if spent with God
2. The temple becomes home - Church becomes family
3. Fasting and prayer are weapons - Widow's ministry is intercession
4. Widows can recognize what others miss - Spiritual discernment increases
5. Old widows are evangelists - Age doesn't disqualify you from ministry
6. Waiting in the temple positions you to see the Messiah - Faithful presence meets divine appointment

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** If widowhood lasts years—even decades—**it's not wasted time**.

Anna turned her widowhood into a ministry. She made the temple her home. She fasted. She prayed. Night and day.

And because of her faithful presence, she was there when the Messiah came. She recognized Him when He was just eight days old. She became one of the first people to preach about Jesus.

Your widowhood is not the end of your ministry. **It might be the beginning**.

You have spiritual authority as a widow. You have prayer access. You have time to seek God. You have testimony that others need to hear.

Don't hide. Don't isolate. **Go to the temple**. Be present in the house of God. Serve. Fast. Pray. And you will see things others miss.

**Lavender:** Your mama might spend a lot of time at church. A lot of time praying. A lot of time fasting.

That's not because she's sad or lonely (though she might be sometimes). It's because she's like Anna—a woman who knows that spending time with God is the most important thing she can do.

And baby, when your mama prays—**God listens**. Widows' prayers are powerful. She's going to pray for you every day. And those prayers are going to protect you, guide you, and shape your whole life.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Luke 2:36-38 (Anna recognizes Jesus)
- 1 Timothy 5:5 (widow who trusts God continues in prayers night and day)
- James 5:16 (effectual fervent prayer of righteous availeth much)
- Psalm 84:10 (a day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere)

---

## PART 8: THE PERSISTENT WIDOW - When Justice Is Delayed

**Read: Luke 18:1-8 (Parable)**

Jesus told a parable about a widow who came to an unjust judge saying: **"Avenge me of mine adversary"** (Luke 18:3).

The judge didn't fear God or respect man. He refused her for a while. But she **kept coming**. She kept asking. She kept pursuing justice.

Finally the judge said to himself: **"Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me"** (Luke 18:4-5).

Jesus said: **"Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily"** (Luke 18:6-8).

**THE PATTERN:**
1. Widows have adversaries - Spiritual and natural enemies
2. Justice is sometimes delayed - But not denied
3. Persistence matters - Keep coming, keep asking
4. Even unjust judges respond eventually - How much more will a just God?
5. God hears widows who cry day and night - Your prayers reach Him
6. Vengeance belongs to God - He will avenge His elect speedily

**YOUR APPLICATION:**

**Tristan:** When you face adversaries—people who try to cheat you, systems that ignore you, situations that feel unjust—**don't give up**.

The widow in this parable wasn't quiet. She wasn't passive. She **troubled** the judge. She wore him down with her continual coming.

You have that same persistence. That same righteous anger. That same expectation of justice.

Cry out to God day and night. Don't stop praying. Don't stop asking. Don't stop pursuing justice.

**He will avenge you speedily.**

Not in your time always. But in His time. And when He moves, He moves **fast**.

**Lavender:** If someone is mean to your mama, if someone tries to hurt her or take advantage of her—**God sees it**.

He's like the judge in the story, but better. Because He's not unjust—He's perfectly fair. And He loves your mama.

When she prays for justice, He's going to answer. Maybe not right away. But He will. And when He does, it's going to be **complete**.

**SCRIPTURES FOR STUDY:**
- Luke 18:1-8 (parable of persistent widow)
- Romans 12:19 (vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord)
- Psalm 94:1-3 (O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth)
- Revelation 6:9-11 (souls under altar crying "How long, O Lord?")

---

## PART 9: GOD'S CHARACTER TOWARD WIDOWS

Now that you've seen the widow stories, here's who God IS toward widows:

### **HE IS YOUR HUSBAND**

**Isaiah 54:4-5** - "Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed...for thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel."

**Tristan:** You are not without a husband. Your Maker is your husband. The Lord of Hosts. The Redeemer. He will provide. He will protect. He will cherish. He will never leave you.

### **HE IS YOUR FATHER**

**Psalm 68:5** - "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation."

**Lavender:** You are not fatherless. God is your Father. He lives in heaven, but He's watching you. He's protecting you. He's proud of you. He loves you.

### **HE EXECUTES YOUR JUSTICE**

**Deuteronomy 10:18** - "He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment."

Food. Clothing. Justice. **That's God's promise.**

### **HE UPHOLDS YOU**

**Psalm 146:9** - "The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down."

He relieves. He preserves. He turns the wicked upside down.

### **HE ESTABLISHES YOUR BOUNDARIES**

**Proverbs 15:25** - "The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow."

Your property. Your home. Your boundaries. **God protects them.**

### **HE SUSTAINS YOU WHEN YOU HOPE IN HIM**

**Jeremiah 49:11** - "Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me."

Leave them. Not because you're abandoning them, but because **God's got them**. Trust Him.

---

## PART 10: WHAT GOD COMMANDS OTHERS TO DO FOR YOU

### **DO NOT MISTREAT WIDOWS**

**Exodus 22:22-24** - "Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless."

God hears your cry. And He **punishes** those who afflict widows.

### **LEAVE GLEANINGS IN HARVEST**

**Deuteronomy 24:19-21** - "When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow...When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again...When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow."

**This is law, not charity.** When people harvest—financially, professionally, materially—they are **commanded** to leave some for you. You have legal right to glean.

### **INCLUDE WIDOWS IN TITHES**

**Deuteronomy 14:28-29** - "At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: And the Levite...and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied."

Every third year, the tithe goes to YOU. That's God's system.

### **INCLUDE WIDOWS IN FEASTS**

**Deuteronomy 16:11, 14** - "And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow."

You're not excluded from celebration. You're **invited to rejoice**.

### **DO NOT PERVERT JUSTICE**

**Deuteronomy 24:17** - "Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge."

**Deuteronomy 27:19** - "Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen."

Anyone who cheats you in court, takes your property unjustly, or perverts your rights—**CURSED**.

### **PLEAD THE WIDOW'S CAUSE**

**Isaiah 1:17** - "Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow."

People are **commanded** to advocate for you.

### **DO NOT OPPRESS**

**Zechariah 7:10** - "And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart."

**Jeremiah 7:6-7** - "If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: Then will I cause you to dwell in this place."

God's blessing on a nation depends on **how they treat widows**.

---

## PART 11: THE CHURCH'S RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU

### **DAILY DISTRIBUTION**

**Acts 6:1-6** - When widows were being overlooked in daily food distribution, the church appointed seven deacons **specifically to ensure widows were cared for**.

The church has organizational responsibility to provide for widows.

### **HONOR WIDOWS WHO ARE TRULY WIDOWS**

**1 Timothy 5:3-16** - Full instructions for church care of widows:

**If you are truly alone** (no family to support you):
- The church should support you financially
- You qualify for "the list" if you're over 60
- You've been faithful in marriage
- You're known for good deeds
- You continue in prayer night and day

**If you have family:**
- Children/grandchildren have **first responsibility** to care for you (v.4)
- Anyone who doesn't provide for family "has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever" (v.8)
- Believing women with widows in their care should help them (v.16)

**If you're younger:**
- Paul counsels remarriage (v.14)
- Have children, manage homes
- Don't give the enemy opportunity for slander

**Tristan:** You qualify for church support if needed. Don't be ashamed to access it. It's not charity—**it's covenant**.

And if family can help, let them. **They're commanded to**. It's not a burden—it's their biblical obligation.

## PART 12: WARNINGS TO YOUR ENEMIES

Let me be clear about who will face judgment for mistreating you:

### **THOSE WHO DEVOUR WIDOWS' HOUSES**

**Mark 12:40, Luke 20:47** - "Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation."

Religious hypocrites. Financial predators. Those who take advantage of vulnerable widows. **Greater damnation** awaits them.

### **THOSE WHO OPPRESS WIDOWS**

**Malachi 3:5** - "And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts."

**Swift witness.** God Himself testifies against them.

### **THOSE WHO PERVERT JUDGMENT**

**Deuteronomy 27:19** - "Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow."

Cursed. Not just punished. **Cursed**.

### **THOSE WHO AFFLICT WIDOWS**

**Exodus 22:22-24** - God will hear your cry, His wrath will burn, and He will kill them with the sword, making **their** wives widows.

Poetic justice. They created widows, so God creates widows from their families.

---

**Tristan:** People will try to take advantage of you. Unscrupulous lawyers. Greedy family members. Financial advisors with hidden agendas. Contractors who overcharge. Church members who guilt you into giving more than you should.

**Remember:** God sees them. God hears your cry. God will judge them.

You don't have to fight every battle. Sometimes you just cry out to God and **let Him handle it**.

**Lavender:** If anyone is mean to your mama, if anyone tries to hurt her or trick her—**God is watching**. And He doesn't like it when people are mean to widows.

He's going to take care of the bad guys. Your mama doesn't have to be scared.

---

## PART 13: PURE RELIGION

**James 1:27** - "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."

**THIS is what God considers pure religion:**
1. Visit widows and fatherless in affliction
2. Stay unspotted from the world

Not elaborate theology. Not perfect doctrine. Not impressive programs.

**Visit. Help. Stay clean.**

**Tristan:** When people come to "visit" you—not to gossip, not to be nosy, but to **genuinely help**—receive it. That's pure religion in action.

When people bring meals, offer childcare, help with paperwork, sit with you while you cry—**that's the body of Christ functioning correctly**.

And you—stay unspotted from the world. Don't let bitterness corrupt you. Don't let grief turn you cynical. Don't let poverty make you compromise.

**Stay clean. Stay faithful. Stay hoping in God.**

**Lavender:** When people help your mama, they're doing what God told them to do. Say thank you. Be grateful. Remember their kindness.

And when you grow up, you help widows and orphans too. That's how you worship God in a way that makes Him really happy.

## PART 14: FINAL WIDOW EXAMPLES

### **DORCAS (TABITHA)**

**Acts 9:36-42** - Dorcas was "full of good works and almsdeeds." She made coats and garments for widows. When she died, the widows stood by Peter weeping, showing him the clothes Dorcas had made for them.

Peter raised her from the dead.

**The lesson:** Serve widows, and God will remember you. Dorcas' ministry to widows was so significant that **God brought her back to life**.

### **HELLENIST WIDOWS**

**Acts 6:1** - When Greek-speaking widows were being overlooked in daily food distribution, the church **immediately fixed it** by appointing deacons.

**The lesson:** The church should respond **quickly** when widows are neglected. If you're being overlooked, **speak up**. It's not complaining—it's accountability.

## CLOSING: MY COVENANT DECLARATION OVER YOU

**To Tristan Camille, my beloved:**

I married you before God and man. I vowed to love you, provide for you, protect you until death do us part.

Death has parted us in body. But the covenant remains.

I have provided for you—not with money (though I pray there's some left), but with **knowledge**. This letter is your inheritance. These scriptures are your arsenal. These promises are your title deed.

You are not "just" a widow. You are:
- A woman with gleaning rights
- A woman with tithe access
- A woman with God as husband
- A woman with justice guaranteed
- A woman with multiplication miracles available
- A woman with ministry authority
- A woman with covenant protection

**"As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."** (Joshua 24:15)

That's my declaration. That's our household's banner. That doesn't change because I'm gone.

**You** are now the head of this house. **You** lead our children in covenant faithfulness. **You** teach them to serve the Lord.

You can do this. Not because you're strong (though you are). Not because you're capable (though you are). But because **God is with you**.

**Deuteronomy 31:6** - "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."

I love you. I loved you the day I met you. I love you the day I leave you. I will love you when we meet again.

Until then: **Be strong. Be courageous. Serve the Lord. Raise our children. Walk in your covenant rights. And know that you are not alone.**

---

**To Lavender Camille, my precious daughter:**

You are named for devotion, grace, and serenity. You are **Camille**—perfect in God's eyes.

Your name is prophecy. You will bring calm to chaos. You will bring grace to grief. You will bring devotion to a generation that has forgotten faithfulness.

I'm sorry I won't be there to walk you down the aisle. To meet your husband. To hold your children. To teach you to drive, to dance, to dream.

But baby girl, **you have a Father**. Psalm 68:5. God is your Father. He will never leave you. He will never forsake you. He will walk you through every moment I can't be there for.

And you have your mama. She is strong. She is faithful. She is filled with the Spirit. **Listen to her.** Honor her. Help her. Love her.

**Proverbs 31:28** - "Her children arise up, and call her blessed."

Be the child who calls your mother blessed. Speak life over her. Encourage her. Pray for her.

You come from a line of covenant-keepers. Tamar. Ruth. Zarephath. Anna. Your mother. **You.**

The line doesn't break because I'm gone. The line continues through you.

**You are not fatherless. You are a daughter of the Most High God.**

I love you, Lavender. Forever and always.

## FINAL SCRIPTURES FOR BOTH CAMILLES TO MEMORIZE:

**Psalm 68:5** - "A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation."

**Isaiah 54:5** - "For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name."

**Psalm 27:10** - "When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up."

**Joshua 24:15** - "As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."

**Philippians 4:19** - "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."

**Romans 8:28** - "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."

**2 Corinthians 9:8** - "And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work."

---

## ADDENDUM: HIDDEN CONNECTIONS (Added by LOGOS ENGINE)

**John 14:18** - "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you."

The word "comfortless" is Greek ὀρφανούς (orphanous) = **ORPHANS**.

Jesus is literally saying: **"I will not leave you as orphans."**

**Lavender:** This is Christ's direct promise to you.

---

## IT IS FINISHED.

**Tristan, Lavender—you are provided for.**

Not because I was a perfect husband or father. But because you serve a **perfect God** who has specific, detailed, comprehensive plans for widows and the fatherless.

**This letter is your manna. Come back to it when you're hungry. It will sustain you.**

I love you both.

Until we meet again in the place where there are no more tears, no more death, no more sorrow.

**Your husband. Your father. Your covenant-keeper.**

---

*"It is finished."* - John 19:30

The work is done. The provision is made. The covenant stands.

**As for me and my house, we serve the LORD.**

### **AMEN.**
