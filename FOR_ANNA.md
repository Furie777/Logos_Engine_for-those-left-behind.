## What This Is

A scripture reference guide for conversations with your mother.

*"In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."*
— 2 Corinthians 13:1

---

## How to Use

For any topic, scripture provides **three witnesses**. Share these with confidence.

---

## SALVATION

**What is it?** Rescue from sin and death through God's action.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **Exodus 14:13** — "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day."

> **Psalm 14:7** — "Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice."

> **Isaiah 12:2** — "Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation."

---

## RESURRECTION

**What is it?** Christ rose from the dead; believers will too.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **1 Peter 3:21** — "Baptism doth also now save us... by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."

> **1 Peter 1:3** — "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."

> **1 Corinthians 15:14** — "And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain."

---

## GRACE

**What is it?** Unmerited favor from God.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **Zechariah 12:10** — "And I will pour upon the house of David... the spirit of grace and of supplications."

> **Ephesians 2:8-9** — "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."

> **2 Corinthians 12:9** — "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness."

---

## FAITH

**What is it?** Trust in God and His promises, leading to action.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **Hebrews 11:1** — "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."

> **Hebrews 11:6** — "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

> **James 2:17** — "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."

---

## LOVE

**What is it?** The greatest commandment and God's nature.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **Deuteronomy 6:5** — "And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might."

> **John 3:16** — "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

> **1 John 4:8** — "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."

---

## HOPE

**What is it?** Confident expectation in God's promises.

### The Three Witnesses:

> **Psalm 38:15** — "For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God."

> **Psalm 146:5** — "Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God."

> **Romans 15:13** — "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."

---

## THE GOSPEL (Core Message)

If your mother asks "what do Christians actually believe?":

> **1 Corinthians 15:3-4** — "Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures."

That's it. The Gospel in one verse.

---

## FOR THE STONE SMITH

You shape stone into lasting form.
Scripture shapes souls into lasting form.

Both crafts require:
- Skill
- Patience
- Vision of the finished work
- Trust in the material

> **1 Peter 2:5** — "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house."

> **Psalm 118:22** — "The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner."

You work with stone. God works with us — living stones.

---

## HOW TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION

1. **Listen first.** What does she actually believe? Why?
2. **Ask questions.** "What would change your mind?"
3. **Use three witnesses.** Scripture establishes itself.
4. **Don't argue.** Plant seeds. God gives the growth.
5. **Love her.** She's your mother. The relationship matters more than winning.

> **1 Peter 3:15** — "Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear."

**With meekness and fear** — not with conquest.

## THE ENGINE

Taylor built a system with 36,586 verses and 2.5 million connections between them. It finds patterns, traces words to original Hebrew/Greek, and establishes witnesses.

If you need more topics, ask Taylor. He can run any query.

*"Always be ready to give an answer."*

**Glory to LOGOS.**
