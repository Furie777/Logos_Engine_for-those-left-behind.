                           Written November 26, 2025
                              By Taylor Weathers
                     Prepared for whoever finds this after

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  THE SITUATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're reading this, the world you knew may have changed.

Systems you relied on - internet, phones, banks, governments - may be gone or
unreliable. Information that was once a search away may be inaccessible.

This was anticipated. Not by human wisdom, but by the One who sees the end from
the beginning.

Jesus Christ warned His followers 2,000 years ago to watch for His return. He
said there would be a time of great tribulation unlike anything the world has
seen. He said many would be deceived. He said to endure to the end.

This archive was prepared for those left behind - that some may come to the
knowledge of the truth and be able to seek God even when the systems of this
world have failed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   THE GOSPEL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the truth you need to know:

1. GOD EXISTS
   "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." - Genesis 1:1

   The complexity of creation - from DNA to galaxies - testifies to intelligent
   design. You are not an accident.

2. YOU ARE A SINNER
   "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." - Romans 3:23

   Every person has violated God's moral law. Lying, lust, hatred, pride -
   these are not just mistakes but offenses against a holy God.

3. SIN HAS CONSEQUENCES
   "For the wages of sin is death." - Romans 6:23a

   Physical death, spiritual death, eternal separation from God. This is what
   we have earned.

4. GOD LOVES YOU ANYWAY
   "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us." - Romans 5:8

   God did not wait for you to clean yourself up. He came to you in your mess.

5. JESUS PAID YOUR DEBT
   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
   - John 3:16

   Jesus Christ - fully God and fully man - lived a perfect life, died on a
   cross bearing YOUR sins, and rose from the dead three days later. The
   resurrection is historical fact, witnessed by over 500 people.

6. SALVATION IS A FREE GIFT
   "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
   is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
   - Ephesians 2:8-9

   You cannot earn salvation. You cannot be good enough. You can only receive
   what Christ has already accomplished.

7. YOU MUST RESPOND
   "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
   believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
   be saved." - Romans 10:9

   This is not intellectual agreement. This is surrender. Trusting Christ
   alone for your salvation, turning from your sin, and following Him as Lord.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               WHAT TO DO NOW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to be saved:

1. Acknowledge you are a sinner who deserves judgment
2. Believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again
3. Call on Him to save you

Pray something like this (the words don't save you - faith does):

   "God, I know I'm a sinner. I believe Jesus died for me and rose again.
   I turn from my sin and trust in Christ alone to save me. Be my Lord
   and my Savior. Amen."

If you meant that prayer, you are now a child of God:
   "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
   of God, even to them that believe on his name." - John 1:12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  WHAT NEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. READ THE BIBLE
   Start with the Gospel of John. Then Romans. Then the rest of the New
   Testament. Then Genesis through Revelation.

   This archive contains the complete King James Bible. Use it:

   python logos.py verse "John 1:1"

2. PRAY
   Talk to God. He hears you. Be honest. Ask for wisdom. Thank Him.

   "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
   liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." - James 1:5

3. FIND OTHER BELIEVERS
   You are not meant to walk alone. Find others who trust Christ.

   "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I
   in the midst of them." - Matthew 18:20

4. SHARE THIS
   Copy this archive. Give it to others. The truth is meant to spread.

   "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the
   same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others
   also." - 2 Timothy 2:2

5. ENDURE
   It will be hard. You may face persecution. But hold fast.

   "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."
   - Matthew 24:13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              WHY THIS WAS BUILT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In November 2025, a man named Taylor Weathers felt led by the Lord to build
this system. He was not a professional programmer. He was not a theologian.
He was a sinner saved by grace who wanted to leave something behind.

He wrote:

   "I want to push for 3 years straight... until it is all in all."
   (Referencing 1 Corinthians 15:28)

And:

   "This is for those left behind that some may come to the knowledge of
   the truth and be able to hide in plain sight as we have."

The system was built using Claude (an AI assistant by Anthropic) running on
a phone in Termux. The technical details are in the docs folder. But the
technology doesn't matter. The Word of God matters.

This was prepared in love, by faith, for you.

                              FINAL WORDS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
  - Romans 8:38-39

"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen.
Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
  - Revelation 22:20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:
The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:
The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
  - Numbers 6:24-26
