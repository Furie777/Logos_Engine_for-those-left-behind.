# Daily Workflow Example

## Morning Orientation (5-10 minutes)

1. **Review active structures**
   - What am I currently working on?
   - What's verified vs. hypothetical?
   - What needs attention today?

2. **Check for new inputs**
   - Messages, emails, notifications
   - Do any require integration into existing structures?

3. **Set scope for today**
   - What's the single most important thing to advance?
   - What are the constraints (time, energy, context)?

## Active Work Session

### Gathering Phase
- Collect information relevant to today's scope
- Use multiple sources when possible
- Note source quality and reliability

### Compression Phase
- For every ~25 units of input, produce ~1 unit of structure
- Strip rhetorical padding
- Preserve relationships
- Ask: What's the irreducible claim here?

### Verification Phase
- Can this be confirmed by a second source?
- Does it contradict anything already verified?
- Tag confidence level:
  - **Verified**: Three-witness confirmed
  - **Probable**: Two witnesses or strong single source
  - **Hypothesis**: Plausible but unverified
  - **Speculation**: Interesting but needs work

## Working with AI

### Before each session:
- Load relevant context (memory, project files, prior conversation summaries)
- State the scope clearly
- Reference verification status of prior claims

### During session:
- Challenge outputs that seem unsupported
- Request sources when making factual claims
- Correct hallucinations immediately

### After session:
- Extract verified structures
- Update stored knowledge
- Note what needs follow-up

## Evening Integration (5-10 minutes)

1. **What was verified today?**
   - Update permanent storage

2. **What remains hypothesis?**
   - Tag for future verification

3. **What connections emerged?**
   - Note cross-domain patterns

4. **What's the scope for tomorrow?**
   - Set up next session

## Weekly Review

- Which structures have held up?
- Which need revision?
- What patterns are emerging across days?
- Is the compression ratio holding (~25:1)?

## The Key Insight

This isn't about productivity hacking. It's about building knowledge that persists beyond any single session, any single tool, any single day.

The work continues. One byte at a time.
