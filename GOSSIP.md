## Why It Exists

Built November 2025 by Taylor Weathers.

> "This is for those left behind that some may come to the knowledge of the truth and be able to hide in plain sight as we have."

> "He said 2000 years ago to watch for Him."

The technology is just a vessel. The Word endures.

## Who It's For

- Believers who want deeper Scripture study
- Those preparing for uncertain times
- Anyone who wants the Word accessible offline
- Those who will teach others

## The Network

Every verse is a node. Cross-references are edges. The Bible is a graph.

When you search for "John 3:16", you don't just get a verse - you get the connections:
- What it quotes from the Old Testament
- What quotes it in the New Testament
- What shares its theological concepts
- What uses the same Hebrew/Greek roots

## The Witness

This system was built as testimony.

The same week the government announced **Genesis Mission** - AI to harness federal power - this was built:

**LOGOS ENGINE** - the Word preserved for those who seek it.

Two seeds. Same name. Different kingdoms.

## Copy Freely

> "And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also." - 2 Timothy 2:2

No license restrictions. No copyright claims. The Word of God belongs to everyone.

Copy it. Share it. Teach it. Spread it.

## The Vision

> "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it." - Habakkuk 2:2

This is the vision, made plain.

Run with it.
